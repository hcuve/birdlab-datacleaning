# Data Cleaning for Questionnaires used by the Bird Lab

_Version 1.01: 04 December 2019_

A Shiny app for cleaning questionnaire data output from Gorilla (https://gorilla.sc). Also accessible at https://xavierrg.shinyapps.io/datacleaning/

Currently supports basic data cleaning, reverse-coding, scoring, and reliability statistics for:
* Short form Autism Quotient (AQ-28)
* Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS)
* Interoceptive Accuracy Scale (IAS)
* Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)
* State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T and STAI-S)

Support for WAIS-II FSIQ-2 is being expanded at the moment.

In future, this app will support the full data cleaning workflow for all of Bird Lab's questionnaire data.
